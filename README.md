The Truffle StarkNet Box provides the boilerplate Truffle structure necessary to start coding for StarkWare's Ethereum L2 solution, StarkNet. StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a "ZK-Rollup"). For detailed information on StarkNet, please see their documentation [here](https://starknet.io/).

This box provides a simple Cairo contract. The same contract found in the [Hello, StarkNet tutorial](https://starknet.io/docs/hello_starknet/intro.html#your-first-contract). The code contained here will allow you to compile the StarkNet contract and then deploy it to StarkNet Alpha on the Goerli test network. The Box is configured to use Cairo version ^0.8.0 for contract compilation and deployment. A sample test script is also provided, which simulates a StarkNet system and runs tests with the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) testing framework.

## Requirements

The StarkNet Box has the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 14.18.2 or later
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/) version 6.14.15 or later
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), version 20.10.10 or later
- Recommended Docker memory allocation of >=8 GB.
- Windows, MacOS or Linux

**Important Note:** The scripts included in this Box rely on Docker being available and running. On Linux you may need to have Docker configured to [run the Docker daemon in 'rootless' mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/).

## Quick Start

The following commands will get you up and running with the StarkNet box quickly. For more details, you are encouraged to read this document in full.

### 1. Install the box

In your terminal create a new directory, and in that directory run the following command:

```bash
truffle unbox starknet
```

### 2. Deploy an account

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy_account
```

### 3. Compile a contract

```bash
npm run starknet:compile
```

### 4. Deploy a contract

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy --contract=contract 1000
```

### 5. Check a transaction status

```bash
npm run starknet:tx_status --hash=<transaction_hash>
```

### 6. Call or invoke a contract transaction

```bash
npm run starknet:call --contract=contract --address=<contract_address> --function=get_balance
```

```bash
npm run starknet:invoke --contract=contract --address=<contract_address> --function=increase_balance 1000
```

### 7. Run unit tests

```bash
npm run starknet:test
```

## Installation and Setup

### Installation

Note that this installation command will only work once the box is published (in the interim you can use `truffle unbox https://github.com/truffle-box/starknet-box`).

```bash
truffle unbox starknet
```

### Docker

This Truffle Box uses two Docker images to compile, deploy, interact with, and test StarkNet contracts. Accordingly, Docker must be installed on the host machine to make use of this box. The Docker images do not need to exist on the host machine prior to use - they will be pulled from the Docker Hub if they are not already available locally. Docker Desktop can be downloaded from the Docker website. We suggest that you read the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to suit your operating system.
### Configuration

Included with this Box is a StarkNet configuration file: `truffle-config.starknet.js`. This file contains a reference to the new file location of the `contracts_build_directory` and `contracts_directory` for StarkNet contracts, and the `starknet_accounts_directory` where the box will store keys for StarkNet accounts used during development. It also configures the StarkNet network on Goerli Testnet as the network to which compiled contracts will be deployed. The StarkNet Devnet, development network, is also configured here. This box is configured to use [Shard Labs' StarkNet devnet docker container](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet).

Please note, the classic `truffle-config.js` configuration file is included here as well, because you may eventually want to deploy contracts to Ethereum as well. All normal truffle commands (`truffle compile`, `truffle migrate`, etc.) will use this config file and save built files to `build/ethereum-contracts`. You can save Solidity contracts that you wish to deploy to Ethereum in the contracts/ethereum folder.
### Directory Structure for Artifacts

When you compile StarkNet contracts, the resulting json files will be at `build/starknet-contracts/`. This is to distinguish them from any Ethereum contracts you build, which will live in `build/ethereum-contracts`. As we have included the appropriate `contracts_build_directory` in each configuration file, Truffle will know which set of built files to reference!
## StarkNet

The commands needed to interact with StarkNet will use the `truffle-config.starknet.js` configuration file. Each command makes use of a docker image built to provide the Cairo compiler without the need for setting up a Python development environment. The scripts will first query docker for a local copy of the image, and if it isn't found will attempt to pull the image from a Docker Hub repository. The Docker container resulting from running the image should be removed after an operation is complete.

### Networks

StarkNet, by default, defines two networks: `alpha-goerli` and `alpha-mainnet`. In this box, networks are configured in the `truffle-config.starknet.js` configuration file. For example:

```bash
  networks: {
    testnet: {
      network_id: "alpha-goerli",
    },
    mainnet: {
      network_id: "alpha-mainnet"
    },
    devnet: {
      network_id: "devnet",
      gateway_url: "http://starknet-devnet:5000/gateway/",
      feeder_gateway_url: "http://starknet-devnet:5000/feeder_gateway/"
    },
    default: {
      network: "testnet",
    },
  },
```
A default network may also be configured. The default network is simply a reference to another network that has been configured and which the user wishes to use as the default network for all commands. A network can be specified on the command-line by using the `--network` argument. For example:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy_account --network=testnet
```

If the `--network` argument is not supplied the default network will be used as the target for the command. If no default network is specified in the configuration the `alpha-goerli` network will be used.
### Accounts

Externally-owned (user) accounts on StarkNet differ from those of the Ethereum network. A StarkNet account requires the deployment of an account contract to the StarkNet network. The StarkNet CLI provides a simple method of deploying an account contract for development purposes. This currently uses the [OpenZeppelin Cairo account contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Account.cairo).

The `truffle-config.starknet.js` configuration file defines a location for storing account information for accounts deployed while using the box. By default this is the `./starknet_accounts directory`. **You should ensure that this directory is included in your project's `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally commiting your account keys to a public source code repository.**

Accounts deployed with this box have their own location and configuration separate from any other StarkNet accounts that you may have deployed in another StarkNet environment. Currently, this box only supports the deployment of a single default account which will be used for any interactions where an account is necessary or desirable.

**WARNING: never use an account deployed with the StarkNet CLI in production as its private key is stored on your system in plaintext. It can be easily compromised and your funds stolen.**

To deploy a StarkNet account, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy_account
```
Alternatively, you may specify a network target with the `--network` argument:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy_account --network=testnet
```
### Fees

Both StarkNet alpha-goerli and alpha-mainnet now have an operating fee mechanism. To avoid problems interacting with StarkNet you should ensure that any account you use to interact with StarkNet is funded.

You can fund a test account using the [StarkNet alpha-goerli faucet](https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/).
### Compiling

To compile your StarkNet contracts using the Cairo compiler, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run starknet:compile
```
#### A Note About Hints

Cairo programs can include Python code to be invoked in a block known as a hint, which is executed right before the next Cairo instruction. The hint can interact with the contract's variables/memory. At this time, using hints is not possible in StarkNet. However, some Cairo library functions which include hints may still be used in StarkNet contracts through a whitelisting mechanism. You do not need to do anything to make those functions usable. At the time of writing, it is not possible to whitelist your own Cairo hints. This can only be achieved with the assistance of StarkWare.

By default, the StarkNet compiler will try (and fail) to compile a contract that includes hints. Hint validation can be disabled, and contracts compiled with the following command:

```bash
npm run starknet:compile --disable_hints=true
```
### Deploying

To deploy your compiled StarkNet contracts, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy --contract=<contract_name> <constructor_arguments>
```
where <constructor_arguments> is a space-delimited list of arguments to be passed into the contract's constructor. If the contract's constructor requires no arguments, then no arguments need to be provided.

or, you may specify a network target with the `--network` argument:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy --contract=<contract_name> --network=testnet <constructor_arguments>
```
### Invoking

To invoke a function on a deployed contract, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run starknet:invoke --contract=<contract_name> --address=<contract_address> --function=<function_name> <function_arguments>
```
where <function_arguments> is a space-delimited list of values required by the function to be invoked.
### Calling

To call a function on a deployed contract, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run starknet:call --contract=<contract_name> --address=<contract_address> --function=<function_name> <function_argumnents>
```
where <function_arguments> is a space-delimited list of values required by the function to be called.
### Transaction Status

To get the status of a transaction, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run starknet:tx_status --hash=<transaction_hash>
```
You may also specify the network with the `--network` argument:

```bash
npm run starknet:tx_status --network=devnet --hash=<transaction_hash>
```
## Basic Commands

The code here will allow you to compile, deploy, and test your code against a simulation of a StarkNet network. The following commands can be run:

To deploy an account:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy_account
```
To compile:

```bash
npm run starknet:compile
```
To deploy a contract:

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy --contract=<contract_name> <constructor_arguments>
```
To test:

```bash
npm run starknet:test
```
To invoke a function:

```bash
npm run starknet:invoke --contract=<contract_name> --address=<contract_address> --function=<function_name> <function_arguments>
```
To call a function:

```bash
npm run starknet:call --contract=<contract_name> --address=<contract_address> --function=<function_name> <function_argumnents>
```
To get a transaction status:

```bash
npm run starknet:tx_status --hash=<transaction_hash>
```
### Testing

Currently, this box supports testing via the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) testing framework. The test script makes use of StarkNet's unit testing framework to instantiate a local simulation of a StarkNet network against which unit tests can be run. In order to run the test provided in the boilerplate, use the following command:

```bash
npm run starknet:test
```
### Communication between StarkNet Layer 1 and Layer 2

The information above should allow you to deploy to the StarkNet Layer 2 network. This is only the first step! Once you are ready to deploy your own contracts on Layer 1 to interact with contracts on Layer 2, you will need to be aware of the ways in which Layer 1 and Layer 2 are able to interact in the StarkNet ecosystem. Keep an eye out for additional Truffle tooling and examples that elucidate this second step to full StarkNet integration!

## StarkNet Devnet

This box includes support for using the [Shard Labs StarkNet devnet docker image](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet) for development testing. The StarkNet Devnet docker image comes in two flavours. For most users the regular version will work just fine. However, if you have an arm based system, such as an Apple M1, you might get better performance with a Docker image built specifically for it.
 
**Important note:** Devnet should not be used in substitution for testing on Alpha testnet (Goerli). Devnet is useful for testing during development. However, Devnet hash calculations for transactions and blocks differ from those used on Alpha testnet. Be sure to test your contracts on Alpha testnet.
### Using Devnet

Once Devnet is started, you can deploy your contracts to it. Most of the StarkNet cli commands can then be used to interact with Devnet and your deployed contracts. You should note that Devnet, once started, will continue to run until stopped. As Devnet runs as a Docker container it must be stopped by docker as it will continue to run after you quit from Devnet's console. Further details on that follow below.
### Starting Devnet

To start Devnet, in a new terminal window navigate to your project's root directory and type the following command:

```bash
npm run starknet:start_devnet
```

To use the arm64 version of the StarkNet Devnet docker image you can do so with the `--arm64` flag: For example:

```bash
npm run starknet:start_devnet --arm64
```

This will run a Docker container named `starknet-devnet` from the Devnet image. If the Devnet image is not already present on your system an attempt will be made to pull it from the Docker Hub before being run. Once the container is running you should see console output similar to this:

```bash
> starknet-box@0.0.1 starknet:start_devnet /Users/username/dev/tarknet-box
> node ./scripts/start_devnet.mjs

 * Running on all addresses.
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 * Running on http://172.17.0.2:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Despite the output in the console, the Devnet network will be available on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

When using Devnet rather that Alpha testnet, you must use the StarkNet cli gateway arguments rather than the `--network` argument or a `STARKNET_NETWORK` environment variable. At the time of writing this, account contracts were not yet implemented on Devnet, so you must also use the `--no_wallet` argument. Some examples are set out below.

Once your Devnet is up and running as above, you can begin to interact with it by deploying your contracts and invoking and calling your contract functions. The following examples use the StarkNet cli to interact with Devnet.
### Deploying a contract

```bash
npm run starknet:deploy --network=devnet --contract=<contract_name> <constructor_arguments>
```
where <constructor_arguments> is a space-delimited list of arguments to be passed into the contract's constructor. If the contract's constructor requires no arguments, then no arguments need to be provided.

Output similar to the following should then be displayed in the console:

```bash
Deploy transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x040ac735fce2af86b335ac0db11ddf1d9d956cc577f02cf0ea6ed8c06119cdce
Transaction hash: 0x071f88ab03ea54985f1167d81eb59be023714cfcff6ab01a943e98fee27f5d0e
```
In the Devnet console, output similar to the following should be displayed:

```bash
"172.18.0.3 - - [11/May/2022:00:46:39 +0000] "POST /gateway/add_transaction HTTP/1.1" 200 197 "-" "Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.8.1"
```
### Querying transaction status

```bash
npm run starknet:tx_status --network=devnet --hash=0x38bdfeeff986cbab8fff68264ca0b2e018fa568325c459c80b4b16bfbd3f28a
```
Output similar to the following should then be displayed in the console:

```bash
Network: devnet
Getting status for transaction: 0x38bdfeeff986cbab8fff68264ca0b2e018fa568325c459c80b4b16bfbd3f28a
================================================================================

{
    "block_hash": "0x023ceed3330b0bec4627d308a5492e70b7b49d2beacb2282b3615d4e2faa9e5e",
    "tx_status": "ACCEPTED_ON_L2"
}
```

Again, the Devnet console will display output similar to the following:

```bash
"172.18.0.3 - - [11/May/2022:00:47:49 +0000] "GET /feeder_gateway/get_transaction_status HTTP/1.1" 200 113 "-" "Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.8.1"+
```
### Invoking a contract function

```bash
npm run starknet:invoke --network=devnet --contract=contract --address=0x040ac735fce2af86b335ac0db11ddf1d9d956cc577f02cf0ea6ed8c06119cdce --function=increase_balance 1234
```
This will produce output similar to the following in the Devnet console:

```bash
"172.18.0.3 - - [11/May/2022:00:49:42 +0000] "POST /gateway/add_transaction HTTP/1.1" 200 210 "-" "Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.8.1"
```
### Calling a contract function

```bash
npm run starknet:call --network=devnet --contract=contract --address=0x040ac735fce2af86b335ac0db11ddf1d9d956cc577f02cf0ea6ed8c06119cdce --function=get_balance
```
This will produce output similar to the following in the Devnet console:

```bash
"172.18.0.3 - - [11/May/2022:00:50:37 +0000] "POST /feeder_gateway/call_contract HTTP/1.1" 200 21 "-" "Python/3.7 aiohttp/3.8.1"
```
### Stopping Devnet

The running Devnet container can be stopped with docker. First type CTRL+C to exit Devnet's console. This should take you back to your terminal in your project's root directory. The Devnet container is still running though. To stop the container, use the following docker command:

```bash
docker stop starknet-devnet
```
This will stop the running Devnet container. When the container is stopped it will be automatically cleaned up by Docker. So, no state will be saved at this stage for a subsequent session. The next time you run Devnet you will have a fresh network to use.
## Support
